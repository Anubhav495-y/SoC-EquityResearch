# SoC-EquityResearch
The project is aimed to automate equity research using Python by building a complete reporting system. <br>
First, we’ll focus on collecting stock data, calculating key financial metrics, and creating charts to visualize trends.<br>
Then, we’ll generate a professional-looking PDF report summarizing the analysis.<br>
There are multiple examples of creating charts to visualize trends on different data sets.<br>
There is a doc file which contains all the major information about equity research.
